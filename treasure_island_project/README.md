# Treasure Island Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python.\
Your mission is to find the treasure by making the right choices.\
At each step you'll be given a situation and asked to type in your
decision.\
The choices you make will decide whether you survive and find the
treasure or the game ends.\
It's a small project to practice Python basics like `if/else`
conditions, user input, and game logic.

## How to Play

1.  Run the Python script.
2.  Follow the prompts in the terminal.
3.  Make your choices by typing the options shown (for example: `left`,
    `right`, `wait`, `swim`, `red`, `blue`, `yellow`).
4.  The game will respond to your choices and tell you if you win or
    lose.

    Your mission is to find the treasure.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download the `task.py` file.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
3.  Run the game with:

```{=html}
<!-- -->

    python task.py

## Notes

-   This is a beginner-friendly project meant to practice basic Python
    concepts like `if/else` statements and user input.
-   The game flow is simple, but you can expand it by adding more
    choices, different paths, or extra features.
