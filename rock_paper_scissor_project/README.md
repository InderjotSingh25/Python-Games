# Rock Paper Scissors (Python)

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built in Python.  
It uses ASCII art to display the choices and lets you play against the computer.

## How it works
- The game asks you to choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
- The computer then randomly picks one of the three options.
- Both choices are displayed with ASCII art.
- The program checks who wins based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules.

## Features
- ASCII art for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Randomized computer choices using Python's `random` module.
- Input validation to handle invalid entries.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

This project is meant for learning and fun. Itâ€™s a basic example of user input, conditionals, and random number generation in Python.  
You can expand it further by adding score tracking, multiple rounds, or even a GUI.
